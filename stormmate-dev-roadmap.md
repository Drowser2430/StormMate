# StormMate Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundational Development (Software-Only)

### 1. Repository Setup (Drowser2430 on GitHub)
- Confirm your `main` branch is clean and ready.

### 2. Define MVP & Architecture
- Identify essential software-only functions (e.g., detect outage, Alexa asks, lights turn on).
- Plan a Modular Architecture and Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to enable future hardware swaps.

### 3. Environment Setup (Local - VS Code)
- Install Python, VS Code, and Python extension.
- Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/Drowser2430/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git`
- Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv` and activate it.
- Set `.venv` as Python interpreter in VS Code.

### 4. Code the Core Simulation
- Branch off: `git checkout -b feature/simulation-v1`
- Develop Simulated HAL components:
  - `SimulatedUPS.get_status()`, `get_battery_level()`
  - `SimulatedSmartPlug`
  - `SimulatedLight.turn_on()`, etc.
- Power Outage Detection Logic
- Alexa Interaction Simulation (text or GUI)
- Automation Flow Logic for light behavior and SMS triggers (simulated)

### 5. Build AI Models (Simple MVPs)
- User Preference Learning: if outage time = evening, activate key zones
- Anomaly Detection: unusual UPS/light usage
- Use synthetic data for training/testing

### 6. Refine & Test
- Add unit tests and simulate outage scenarios for robustness.

### 7. Commit & Push
- Commit and push to your simulation branch:
  `git push origin feature/simulation-v1`

### 8. Merge (Optional)
- If stable, merge into `main` and delete branch.

## Phase 2: Showcasing & Future Planning (Still Software-Focused)

### 1. Create Demo Assets
- Screen recordings of simulation
- Voice demos of Alexa prompts
- Simple animated diagrams (Canva/Blender)
- Documentation for simulation and roadmap

### 2. Promote Software POC
- Leverage TikTok + GitHub ReadMe
- Emphasize automation, intelligence, problem-solving

### 3. Plan for Hardware Acquisition
- Research: smart plugs, UPS w/ data, Alexa integrations, Raspberry Pi
- Funding: grants, pitch contests, crowdfunding
- Focus: prioritize minimal viable hardware for end-to-end proof (e.g., 1 light, 1 smart plug, 1 Raspberry Pi)
